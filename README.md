# Text-BasedRPG
The initial code is constructed with the aid of the Zenva course "Learn C++ By Making a Text-Based RPG".
All of the subsiquent updates following the initial commit are my own code expantions to the game. 

My expected updates include
-The ability to view inventory [INCLUDED]
-The ability to view stats [INCLUDED]
-The ability to lock chests and unlock with keys [INCLUDED]
-The ability to have enemies drop loot that can be claimed by the player [INCLUDED]
-The ability to manage a coin purse for the player [INCLUDED]
-The ability to include a chance mechanic for fights (computer rolls a d20 to see if an attack hits) [INCLUDED]
-Expand the dungeon to more than 4 rooms
